I led Alberta's graduate student advocacy efforts to the Government of Alberta's review of its tuition regulations. This document comprised part of that effort.

As part of this effort I [designed and executed a survey of all of Alberta's graduate students](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LTNWl52i6aRpIv95bpPNTqXVzKjcYvTT), coordinated the participation of student leaders from Alberta's universities, and advocated on behalf of students to government officials.

This work culminated in introduction of [Bill 19 - An Act to Improve the Affordability and Accessibility of Post-Secondary Education](https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/bills/bill/legislature_29/session_4/20180308_bill-019.pdf).
